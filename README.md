# Invasive-Species-Spread-Simulation
 A python imulation to model the spread of invasive species, inspired by a model given in one of my maths lectures

This models outputs a numpy array, in which 0's represent whent the species is not present, and 1's represent when present. The variable p_spread is the probability that a species will travel to a neighbouring site (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally).
